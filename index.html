        <h1> HI!
        </h1>
        <p> I'm Rudrasree. I'm a Coder, a Artist and a Crafter. I attend coding classes and I made a lot of games, websites and more. I love to make many things like makeing a painting when I'm free so I'm Artist too. Which lead to some 3d ones like origami crafts. I do many thing from cards to toys with paper. I do craft so i'm also crafter. So in this website I'm going to show my painting, craft and website.
